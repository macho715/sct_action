# SCT Ontology Improvement Spec

## Summary

This specification defines the contract for improving the SCT ontology layer used by `DSV Invoice Audit & Final Validator PRO` GPT Actions.

The implementation must extend the ontology resolver, evidence mapper, TYPE-B classifier, gate checker, OpenAPI Action schema, and GPTS operating instructions so invoice audit decisions can distinguish:

1. logistics charge types,
2. supporting document types,
3. rate basis status,
4. Customs Inspection override behavior,
5. final PASS blockers.

The system must remain read-only, dry-run, masked, and non-mutating. It must not approve invoices, execute payment, mutate ERP/TMS/WMS records, or disclose raw contract rates.

Source plan: `docs/SCT_ONTOLOGY_IMPROVEMENT_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`

Known local references:

1. `wrangler.toml` points this package to `cloudflare_worker/worker.js`.
2. `cloudflare_worker/worker.js` exposes root Action routes and `/mcp/...` aliases.
3. `openapi/hvdc_sct_ontology_actions.apikey.yaml` and `openapi/hvdc_sct_ontology_actions.noauth.yaml` expose GPT Action operations.
4. `gpts/GPT_INSTRUCTIONS_SCT_ONTOLOGY_ROUTER.md` requires Action calls before SCT-related final judgments.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### US-001. Resolve document terms as ontology nodes

Given a GPT Action request containing `BOE`, `Bill of Entry`, `CI/PL`, `CIPL`, `POD`, or `delivery proof`  
When `resolveSctOntologyTerm` is called  
Then the response must classify the term as a `DocumentType` where applicable  
And the result must include an SCT document code, confidence, risk level, and reviewer action.

Independent tests:

1. `BOE` resolves to `SCT.DOC.BOE`.
2. `CI/PL` resolves to `SCT.DOC.CI_PL`.
3. `POD` resolves to `SCT.DOC.POD`.

### US-002. Resolve rate basis terms as ontology nodes

Given a GPT Action request containing `AT COST`, `at actuals`, `AS PER OFFER`, or `per offer`  
When `resolveSctOntologyTerm` or rate basis classification is called  
Then the response must classify the term as a `RateBasis`  
And the response must not disclose any raw rate amount.

Independent tests:

1. `AT COST` resolves to `SCT.RATE.AT_COST`.
2. `AS PER OFFER` resolves to `SCT.RATE.AS_PER_OFFER`.
3. Missing supporting evidence keeps the result AMBER or ZERO, not PASS.

### US-003. Override Customs Inspection before generic Customs

Given an invoice line description `CUSTOMS INSPECTION FEE`  
When `resolveSctOntologyTerm` or `dryRunClassifyTypeB` is called  
Then the line must classify as `SCT.CHARGE.CUSTOMS_INSPECTION`  
And TYPE-B must be `Inspection`  
And generic Customs Clearance rules must not override this result.

Independent tests:

1. `CUSTOMS INSPECTION FEE` returns TYPE-B `Inspection`.
2. `CUSTOMS CLEARANCE` remains TYPE-B `Customs`.
3. `BILL OF ENTRY FEE` remains TYPE-B `Customs` and links to BOE evidence.

### US-004. Generate evidence requirements from SCT codes

Given mapped SCT charge, document, or rate basis codes  
When `mapRequiredEvidence` is called  
Then the response must return required evidence, evidence status, reviewer action, and gate relevance.

Independent tests:

1. Customs requires BOE, broker invoice, CI/PL, and customs approval evidence.
2. Inspection requires inspection approval, broker/customs invoice, and BOE remark when applicable.
3. AT COST requires vendor/broker invoice, approval evidence, and amount match.
4. AS PER OFFER requires offer approval, client approval, and line amount match.

### US-005. Block final PASS when critical gates are incomplete

Given an invoice audit payload missing final subtotal before VAT  
When `checkSctOntologyGate` or `dryRunValidateInvoicePack` is called  
Then final PASS must be blocked  
And the response must return ZERO or an explicit pending final subtotal blocker.

Independent tests:

1. Missing final subtotal before VAT returns `pass_allowed=false`.
2. Rate basis `MISSING` or `CONFLICT` blocks PASS.
3. HS/UAE, DEM/DET, OOG/stowage, and final reconciliation evidence gaps become ZERO candidates.

### US-006. Preserve GPTS Action observability

Given a GPTS preview test for an SCT-related question  
When the GPT calls the Action endpoint  
Then the answer must clearly report Action and ontology usage status.

Independent tests:

1. Successful Action result reports `ACTION_CALLED: YES`.
2. Successful ontology usage reports `SCT_ONTOLOGY_USED: YES`.
3. Endpoint failure reports the failure cause such as `NO_ROUTE_404`, `NO_AUTH`, `SCHEMA_ERROR`, `TIMEOUT`, `NO_MATCH`, or `INSUFFICIENT_INPUT`.

## Assumptions & Dependencies

1. Assumption: `docs/SCT_ONTOLOGY_IMPROVEMENT_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` is the approved implementation brief for this spec.
2. Assumption: The GPT Action backend remains `https://hvdc-ontology-chatgpt-app.mscho715.workers.dev`.
3. Assumption: The package-level `wrangler.toml` remains valid for deployment with `main = "cloudflare_worker/worker.js"`.
4. Dependency: Before implementation, confirm whether the actual deployment source is this package or the separate `C:\Users\jichu\Downloads\HVDC Ontology Grounded` repository.
5. Dependency: GPTS preview testing must be available after deployment to verify Action behavior from the ChatGPT UI.
6. Dependency: If API key auth is enabled through `SCT_ACTION_API_KEY`, GPT Builder Action authentication must send the matching API key header.
7. Dependency: Test payloads must cover DocumentType, RateBasis, Customs Inspection override, evidence mapping, gate-check, and rate lookup.
